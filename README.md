Public analysis of ODS Channel questionnaire statistics

## Installation and initial setup

```bash
poetry install
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

In case of missing python version and poetry, they can be installed with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry). Alternatively, you can try using separate [script](https://github.com/Hiyorimi/i_am_new_python_developer) to setup developer environment at your own risk.
